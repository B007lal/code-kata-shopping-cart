My solution to the code Kata is in the file "Solution.txt".
The code has been written in Java and been commented for your convenience.
I had managed to complete the exercise in just under an hour and a half.

Since I haven't done coded in some time, I had to just refresh my memory on my programming skills.
I appreciate the challenge!
Thanks for your time,

Bilal Qureshi
