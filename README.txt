My solution to the code Kata is in the file "Solution.txt".
The code has been written in Java and been commented for your convenience.
I had managed to complete the exercise in just under an hour and a half.
I have made sure the program meets the specifications set.
What I can improve to this program is to add error checking for the input.

Thanks for your time,

Bilal Qureshi
